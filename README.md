Networking Basics for Cyber Security(wireshark).
This project starts with learning basic networking concepts such as IP address, MAC address, DNS, TCP, and UDP.
Next, Wireshark is installed to capture live network traffic.
Different packet filters like HTTP, DNS, and TCP are used to analyze the captured data.
The TCP three-way handshake is observed to understand connection establishment.
Plain-text and encrypted traffic are identified to compare HTTP and HTTPS. 
DNS queries are captured and analyzed. Finally, packet captures are saved and observations are written in simple language as part of the internship/STSP activity.
